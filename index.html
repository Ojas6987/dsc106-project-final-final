                California is one of the most populous states in the nation, with a strong economy built around technological innovation.
                Over the past two decades, its population has continued to grow as more and more people flock to the state in pursuit of 
                success. Below is a plot of the state's population trend over time.

                It's clear that California's population has grown immensely over time. However, there's something interesting about the past few years
                that stands out: California's population has seen a clear dip starting right before the start of the new decade. California,
                the supposed golden state where everyone wanted to live, suddenly didn't seem to be like a hot ticket. This piqued out interest, and we set out to find
                how migration patterns were shifting in California, focusing on two times of crisis: 2008 and the start of the 2020s.

                This visualization shows the migration trends from California to other states in the USA.
                The data highlights the number of people moving from California to various states across the country.

                The arrows indicate significant migration flows, where more than 10,000 people have moved from California
                to the respective states. Hover over the states to see more details about the migration numbers.

                The map shows a pretty healthy mix of migration both towards and from California. One trend that stands out is where 
                people are going to from California, and where they're coming from. The east coast seems to be the most popular immigrators 
                for California, while former Californians stay in the West, flocking mostly north or towards Texas, the most popular state to 
                go to from California. These trends for the most part however drastically change when looking at 2022 data.
